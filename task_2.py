@Task: Automate a sign up form

1.	Use form at https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form
2.	Using Java or Python and Selenium, create at least 5 automated tests that will test the form’s functionality (you can include more scenarios you’d like to test, but don’t have to implement them)
3.	Send us a link to your Git repository with sources on a publicly accessible service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
